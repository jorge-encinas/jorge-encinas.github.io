Education and Labor Market Effects of Being Documented: Evidence from DACA (with Matthew Shaw)

How do Postsecondary Institutions Respond to Appropriations Changes (with Alexis Gable and Susha Roy)

**Abstract:** Higher education is often used as the release valve for state legislatures facing budgetary crises. While these changes may appear to affect all public postsecondary institutions, that may not be the case in practice. Different institutions may be more or less sensitive due to their various revenue streams. For example, while flagship universities may be able to substitute state appropriations with other forms of funding from increased out-of-state tuition or higher levels of philanthropic donations, smaller state colleges and community colleges may not be able to make the same adjustments. As a result, budget cuts that appear institution neutral on a per capita basis may have different and inequitable impacts on student expenditures. Our study investigates the sensitivity and response of public postsecondary institutions following changes in state appropriations, focusing on how public four-year institutions differ in their response when compared to two-year institutions. We find that two-year institutions are indeed much more dependent on state appropriations than four year institutions. While four-year institutions make up budget cuts through increased tuition and other revenue sources, budget cuts flow through to expenditures at two-year institutions, where instructional spending, student, and academic support decrease in years with state budget cuts.
