Bio
======

Hi! I'm Jorge Encinas. I'm a PhD Student in education policy and program evaluation at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. I study the economics of higher education. My research is focused on evaluating policies and programs designed to increase college success and completion. I'm also interested in studying policies and programs designed to help individuals successfully enter the workforce. In my research, I focus on how these policies effect minoritized individuals and immigrants. My CV can be found [here](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fcAZNaM-GFHxyn0DT_m_DAcA#Encinas%5FCV).
