Bio
======

Hi. I'm Jorge Encinas. I'm a PhD Student in education policy and program evaluation at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. I study the economics of higher education. I focus on policy and programs designed to increase college success and completion, as well as the transition to employment. I especially focus on how these policies effect historically underepresented groups such as black and brown people and immigrants.
