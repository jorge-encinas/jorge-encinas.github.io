Welcome to my website! I'm a PhD Student in education policy and program evaluation at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. I study the economics of higher education, focusing on evaluating policies and programs designed to increase college success and completion. I'm also interested in studying policies and programs designed to help individuals successfully enter the workforce. A lot of my research is interested in how different policy areas interact with higher education policies and outcomes for students. In my research, I focus especially on low-income, minority, and immigrant individuals.
