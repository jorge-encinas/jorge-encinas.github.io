Welcome to my website! I'm a PhD Student in education policy and program evaluation at the Harvard University. I study the intersection of higher education policy and other policy areas, such as immigration, transportation, and health care policy. My research training is in economics and causal inference. My research is interested in how these different policy areas interact with higher education policies and outcomes for students. In my research, I focus especially on low-income, minority, and immigrant individuals.

I'm a doctoral research at the [Harvard Project on the Workforce](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/team), where I work on researching the workforce development sector and how it interacts with higher education institutions. Before Harvard, I obtained a Masters in Public Policy from Vanderbilt University, where I also worked as a health policy analyst at Vanderbilt's Department of Health Policy. I also hold a bachelor's degree in economics from Brigham Young University.

I'm a first generation Mexican immigrant, coming to the U.S. in my early childhoold. My experiences as an immigrant seeking higher education inform a lot of my research. I'm married to my wife Lindsey, and have 4 wonderful children: Eloise(9), Mabel(7), Rio(5), and Solomon(2).
